Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The goal here was to create a C++ program that will allow users to see how much their investments are growing providing them with a user interface where they can submit data like Monthly Deposit, Annual interest, etc.
What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did a great job at writing notes down about how to approach solving the problem first. I know this was mentioned in 1a and I just say this because I tend to hop right into an editor and start typing away, sometimes not fully understanding the task at hand. When I brought up the assignment rubric I wrote out with pen and paper how the flow of the program will work. This was really helpful.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Once way I would enhance my code would be to explore some c++ testing frameworks. One in particular I would try first is Catch2. I would also like to get into a habit of leaving better comments.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

In this particular project it wasn't necessarily the logic of the program, I would have to say it was the project configuration and at times misunderstanding the C++ syntax. Tool's that really helped be get past roadblocks were Github, Stackoverflow, C++ Syntax guide docs.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I've always wanted to create a video game or embedded system but was too nervous to face a lower level language, the course has opened my mind to exploring different realms. Also, I got to experience a different editor (VS Studio) which I found to be tricky but indeed powerful.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My plan was to follow style guide procedures for this use codeacademy to help with it by ready there glosery
